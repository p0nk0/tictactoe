(* [compute_next_move] is your Game AI's function.

   [game_ai.exe] will connect, communicate, and play with the game server,
   and will use [compute_next_move] to pick which pieces to put on your
   behalf.

   [compute_next_move] is only called whenever it is your turn, the game
   isn't yet over, so feel free to raise in cases where there are no
   available spots to pick. *)
